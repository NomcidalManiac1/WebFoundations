          <h2>Week 2; Information and Social Engineering</h2>
          <p>The lecture covered areas relating to information security and techniques for social engineering. In this lecture I learned that the fines for a company that breaches the data protection act used to be a maximum if £500,000 but is now 4% of the annual turnover of the company, which means there is a more significant impact for companies such as Apple, as under the new fine, they could lose up to £6 Billion, compared to the measly £500,000 it used to be. This was done so that there was more of a deterrent for larger companies not following robust security guidelines.</p>
          <p>I also learned that there are many social engineering techniques, including ‘Tailgating’, which is where a person follows someone closely in order to gain access to a restricted area they shouldn’t. </p>
          <p>In the practical session, I learned that each student that attends the University of Portsmouth has their own cloud based virtual machine, hosted by google, which we can use for hosting our website and database projects. </p>
      </section>

          <h2>Week 3; Web Security</h2>
          <p>In the lecture this week, I learned that there are services that exist to protect companies against
          DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, one of which is called Cloud Face.
          I also learned that there are forums where cyber security professionals and
          enthusiasts communicate about common types of attacks happening around the
          world at the moment, and sharing key information such as where they are originating,
          and what kind of systems they are targeting. </p>
          <p>This week in the practical session, I learned that almost everything we do in our daily lives generates information that can, if enough of it is pieced together, be traced back to us as an individual – perhaps this is why Nick is so paranoid... </p>
          <p>I also learned that Rich has a strange fascination with building foundations, and that he likes to set weird challenges, such as finding out the location he took the photo for the Web Foundations Moodle banner (122 Leadenhall Street for those of you who are interested)</p>

          <h2>Week 4; Reviewing Literature</h2>
          <p>This weeks lecture was about how we go about reviewing academic literature, and was very adamant that the coursework was a literature review and not an essay or literary review – a very important distinction to make apparently. What I learned is that a literature review is an essay that has all the fun sucked out of it (no personal opinions, no proving an argument, etc..) which takes something that was already dull and boring, into an apparently more mind-numbing experience that watching Prime Ministers Questions. </p>
          <p>In the practical session, we looked at how to find sources, and what classed as a god source of information, and I also learned that no number of sources is ever enough – no matter how short a literature review is.  </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Week 5; Academinc Writing</h2>
        <p>Similar to the previous weeks lecture, we looked at material relating to our literature review coursework – this week we were on to the style of academic writing. In this… riveting… lecture, I learned that I need to put an awful lot of thought into the voice I use when writing my literature review, as it needs to be written for ‘Sun Readers’, which means it has to be technical enough for the established audience of highly tech-savvy people who would be interested in this work, but also ‘dumb’ enough so that your average Joe (or Joy) can read it, and get the gist of what it is talking about. I also leaned that It must have a very neutral voice, and be very evidence based. </p>
        <p>For this weeks practical we had to complete a worksheet where we needed to look at different methods for making our writing ore academic, such as knowing when to use more formal words and phrases, compared to informal, as well as choosing appropriate adjectives.</p>

          <h2>Week 6; Introduction to Markup</h2>
          <p>Things started to get a little more interesting with this week’s lecture, as we were introduced to the origins of HTML, and how it evolved from simple markup (using special sets of characters to specify text emphasis and size) to full HTML etc. where we have few special characters, which are used to make up tags to offer more flexibility and control over content. I also learnt that Rich also has a fairly un-healthy obsession for Star Wars, to the point he is drawing Darth Vader out of symbols, using the opening crawl text from A New Hope EVERYWHERE, and replacing the basic code example of ‘Hello, World!’ with ‘Hello, Tatooine’ (A bit weird) in the practical session for our first web page. </p>

          <h2>Week 7; Writing the Literature Review</h2>
          <p>Upon reflection, I think I really would rather watch Prime Ministers Questions…</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Week 8; Seperatign Form and Content</h2>
          <p>And so the saga continues – This week we finally got into some interesting stuff, such as separating the content of a page (what is written in HTML) and how it is displayed (Cascading Style Sheets, or ‘CSS’). I learned quite a bit about CSS, in that you can fully animate elements without the need for the dreaded JavaScript <em>*shudder*</em>. I also learned that in HTML, apparently you don’t need to put “ ” around the content of the id attribute in HTML, contrary to what I have always known ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
          <p>This week also saw the return of Richs’ obsession with all things Star Wars as I learned how to make the opening crawl in HTML and CSS (which was pretty cool in all honesty)</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Week 9; Productivity and Efficiency</h2>
            <p>As it turns out, there is a far more amazing HTML and CSS editor than good ol’ Notepad++ called Atom. And despite at the start of the lecture where Rich and Jacek said they weren’t going to push it as the go-to editor… they totally pushed it. However, I did learn that it has tonnes of good features to make writing HTML and CSS far more productive, such as the ability to have multiple cursors, and that is will automatically insert the main html elements (head, meta charset, body, title etc.) simply by typing html and clicking tab! (One happy Atom convert here)</p>
          <p>The practical was in a similar vein to the lecture, and involved fiddling around with Atom.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Week 10; Design</h2>
          <p>This week I learned that design isn’t just about making something look pretty, but also involves doing more work on how the content works, so that the user has less to do. This is important as users are more likely to be happy with the product offered. It also touched briefly on the idea of design templates, which make designing a website easier if you can apply an already working and deployed template to it. </p>
          <p>In this weeks practical I learnt that Rich and Jacek can be rather evil, as they enjoyed watching us provide our own solutions as to how menu items should be arranged for a hotel resort, all of which we were told would be wrong, no matter what we did. </p>

      <section>
          <h2 id="imgtags">Week 11; Using Images</h2>
            <p>Another shocking revelation this week, as I learn that the <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag that I’ve been using the entire time I write HTML, is a not only a completely stupid way of doing it, but also horrifically depreciated. Instead, there is a <strong>&lt;picture&gt;</strong>, tag, which allows you to define multiple sources for an image – this can be used to improve the compatibility of a web pa,ge, as you can build in support for different pixel density screens, as well as different browsers that might not be able to display certain image types (.svg, .webp etc.) I also learnt that there is a <strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong>, tag, that can be used to group images and text, to provide captions, or hyperlink them to pages etc.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <a href="example1.html" tabindex="5">Here is an example page that makes use of the <strong>&lt;picture&gt;</strong> tag to display different image types depending on the browser</a> </li>

          <h2>Week 12- Christmas!</h2>
          <p>In the lecture, we witnessed Jack and Rich speed code a multimedia Advent calendar styled after (you guessed it) Star Wars!! Yes indeed! During this process, we were showed some further techniques to do with CSS and perspective to give things a subtle, but interesting animations – such as a door opening on the advent calendar. This got me interested, as there seems to be many things that can be done with animations in CSS alone.
          After a brief search I found that CSS alone has limited but effective functionality for animation, such as the scrolling number below
          </p>
          <div id="digit"><div id="stripe" tabindex="8">0123456789</div></div>
          <script src="scripts/scrollAnim.js"></script>
          <p>This animation is created using the following css;</p>
          <picture>
              <source srcset="Images/code_example/code.png" type="image/png" >
              <source srcset="Images/code_example/code.jpeg" type="imge/jpeg" >
              <source srcset="Images/code_example/code.gif" type="image/gif" >
              <img src="Images/code_example/code.jpeg" alt="An example of some CSS code">
          </picture>
          <p>This formats the text 0123456789 into a single visible digit, that is centered on the screen. There is then a simple .js script that adds the .animate tag to the element which begins the text scrolling across one digit at a time. The animation speed is dictated by the transform attributes. For example, the transform: translate(-90%); moves whatever it describes 90% of the elements widt to the left hand side of the screen.  </p>
          <p>I also learned that one of the methods for defining animations is called the Bezier Curve, which is a mathematical formula that can be used to determine how fast and animation happens at a certain point. The concept works using key points which allow a graph to be drawn between them, the gradient of which can determine the speed of how an animation happens. Take the bellow two examples of the X-Wing, where the first is animated in accordance with the Bezier curve of the line (0,0) – (1,1);</p>

          <img src="Images/xwing.gif" tabindex="9" alt="Star Wars X-Wing" class="xwing" onclick="this.style.left='85%'">

          <p>In a slightly different fashion, by editing the points defined in the cubic-bezier css attribute to (.5, -1, .5, 2), we can create subtly different animation effects as the second X-Wing bellow will demonstrate;</p>

        <h2>Week 15 - Usability</h2>
        <p>The usability lecture was quite informative about what not to do in order to try and make something more useable. Largely, this came down to the matter that I should be designing something that is easy and intuitive to use, that I don’t have to provide any sign-posts for users or visitors to follow in order to navigate. In addition to this, the practical was based on looking at how useable other websites are in terms of design, and functionality. While looking at some examples of websites, such as http://www.ericafirment.com/ and http://mariusz.cc/ which are both good looking and intuitive designs when viewed full screen. However, when the window is shrunk or compressed, both sites begin to exhibit a few issues such as overflowing text/images, menu items not fitting on the bars etc. which are all fairly easy fixes (or so I was informed by Jaeck)  </p>
        <p>After taking some inspiration from these examples, I began to re-style my own website to; </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Look better</li>
            <li>Be intuitive and easy to use</li>
            <li>Have no window scalability issues</li>
          </ul>

      <p>
        To begin with I started modifying the index page to a style that I liked and got everything positioned how I wanted. Once that was done, I began to resize the window and see what was breaking and what I could keep the same. As all of the text sizes were a set size – all the text kept overflowing and breaking / going out of line etc. At first I attempted to adjust the values by  making them all %’s – however as I found out, in CSS % means ‘percent of default size’ – so the text would remain a fixed size still no matter what size the window is. After searching for a while I cam across the view width and view height values (vh, vw) which Rich had mentioned before. These values set the text to a certain percentage of the size of the viewport width or height,   meaning that this will scale to fit the size of the viewing window -Perfect!
        </p>
        <p>Another issue that I ran into was that the background image was breaking and started to tile in different sized windows, as the aspect ratio was broken. As well as this, on certain sized screens some elements went off of the screen due to the rigid margin properties I had given them. In order to fix this, I had to look into CSS @media queries, which are able to read certain information about the device the page is being viewed on (like screen size and pixel density etc..) By doing this, I was then able to set different styling for certain screen orientations and sizes etc.. thus making the page scale and present itself in a decent manner on all screens. One of the issues I ran into along the way with the CSS queries was that if I had one defined higher up in the style sheet, it was being overwritten by anything I had written bellow for the same element. This can be avoided by putting all media queries at the bottom, however I found that it is possible to use @media queries to decide on loading a specific style sheet, meaning I simply have multiple sheets to do the styling. The issue with this however, is that I would have to recode the same thing multiple times, and it would have an impact on page loading times as there is more data to be downloaded. Therefore, I am sticking with a single, horribly messy, style sheet.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Week 17 - SVG</h2>
        <p>This week I learned that Scalable Vector Graphics (svg) are not a standard iage file tyoe that can be created by exporting an image for an editor, and is in fact a form of XML that describes shapes, and what color/lint thickness they should have, as well as other such values. </p>
        <p>The different types of shape that can be defined in svg are the 'rect', 'circle', 'path', 'line', and 'polygon'. Each of these takes in different types of paramaters, such as x/y points and a width/height for a rect, which (obviously) is used to draw a square or a rectangle;</p>
        <p>
          <svg width="50%" height="10%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
            <rect x="0" y="0" width="25%" height="100%"  fill="#13f" stroke="black"/>
            <rect x="200" y="0" width="40%" height="100%"  fill="#13f" stroke="black"/>
          </svg>
      </p>
      <p>Another thing I learned about SVG is that it can either be hard coded in the HTML of a document, as above, but it can also be saved as a seperate file which can be used as the sourc for both &lt;img&gt; and &lt;picture&gt; tags, as with the university logo below;
      </p>
      <img id="logo" src="Images/logo.svg" alt="University of Portsmouth Logo">
      <p>This image is compsed of three shapes - all of which are anclosed paths - one for the blue 'U' shape, one for the purple 'P' shape, and the third is the weird trapezium-ish shape in the middle, which has a greay trnsparent fill to give (as close as i could get) the colors for the shading on the other shapes. However, this issue could be averted if I instead used two shapes for the shaded areas, each one filled with the correct color. (I'm just a bit lazy)</p>
      <p>On a completely unrelated note, as his discovery log has stated to get a bit lengthy - I thought it wise to include a 'back to top' button. Whilst this is relatively easy to set up the base button in hatml and css (create an a tag, add the image and an ID so it can be style, et voila.) However, with this method, the arrow persits even when we are at the top of the page.</p>
      <p>The esiest way I have found to overcome this is with the use of a little JavaScript, which will detect whether or not the page has been scrolled, and then fade in the button - or if we are back at the top, fade it out again. Briliant! Now we can return to the top whenever we want!</p>
      <p>However, there is a small issue with this method, where it dosn't quite scroll all the way back up to the top of the page. This is due to the way that I have created the navbar, and that it is constantly at the top of the screen. Fortunately, there is et more javasrcipt that we can us in order to scroll to the top, which also adds a nice little scroll animation as well</p>
      <p>For the fade in/out of the button, we use an if else statment that checks whether the page has been scrolled by a minimum ammount, and if it has, then the html element of a specific id is shown, else it is not shown. Then for the scroll to top feature, we have to have a special 'listener' to detect whether or not it has been clicked, and when it is, we set the scrllTop value to 0, which takes us back up to the top of the page. </p>
