-Hello, welcome to my website, as you can see, this is the front page.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
-The video that I am currently recording will go in this spot here, and it is just a quick tour.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.000
-So at the moment so if we click that [Home Button], it's not going to do anything.

00:13.100 --> 00:18.000
-as you can see I've got my literature review, and my discovery log, and a couple of validation buttons.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.000
-So if we go ahead and start with those, lets get them both open.

00:22.100 --> 00:28.000
-so the html has validated with no errors, as has the css.

00:28.100 --> 00:36.000
-so I only have the css button on the front page, because it is the same stylesheet used without so there is no sense in validating it two other times

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
-here we have my literature review, we've got a nice menu at the top and it just scrolls through

00:43.100 --> 00:50.000
-So it's got my entire literature review, It's got the bibliography and We've got a nice little scroll to top button which is covered in my discovery log

00:50.100 --> 00:57.000
-and if we quickly validate this page - there we go, that one has validated with no errors

00.57:100 --> 01:00.000
-now if we have a quick look at the discovery log

01:00.100 --> 01:06.000
-I've got most of the weeks in here, scrolling down I've got a couple of little animations that are just for a bit of fun

01:06.100 --> 01:08.000
-as well as some svg

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
-and then, again we have our back to top button

01:12.500 --> 01:20.000
-and that is it, so then if we finally validate this page - there we are
-we can see that that has no errors as well
